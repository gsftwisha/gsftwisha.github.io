Twisha, or The Women In Self-Health Awareness, is a project by GramSheel Foundation. 

The scope of Project Twisha include women’s health issues (direct objective), child health issues (parallel objective), and domestic health issues (indirect objective targeting alcoholism, sanitation, water etc.)

Twisha designs kits for assessing self-health, related books, and simple health packets (containing PCC etc.). The media initiatives under Twisha produce blogs, articles, and tweets. Along with this Twisha trains volunteers as self-health awareness enablers. Twisha also produces videos covering expert advice and panel discussions or events related to women’s health issues.

Twisha’s activities include and are based on strong research and development (R&D). This primarily concerns medical research on women’s health issues and medical devices / telemedicine for women.
